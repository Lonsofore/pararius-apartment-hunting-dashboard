# Pararius Apartment Hunting Dashboard

I built this app to help me in my apartment hunt in Amsterdam. It scrapes Pararius.com for apartments that I'm interested in and populates a nice dashboard with the results where I can categorize them, compare them, add notes or see my daily commute time and distance for each listing.

## Features

- Scrap a Pararius URL every hour for new listings.
- Maintain a local database for all properties fetched so far.
- Add apartments to a new category automatically.
- Allow favoring, shortlisting or hiding properties.
- Allow saving text notes on each property.
- Calculate the daily commute time and distance to a specific address.
- Compares: price, surface area, bedrooms, whether it is furnished, neighborhood, distance, and compute time.
- Show a map for each category.

Still to come if I have time:

- Chrome notifications for new listings.
- Chrome notifications for shortlisted or interesting listings that are not available anymore.
- Sorting listing on various parameters. (especially the commute time and distance)

## Google APIs

In order for this app to work and show you maps, commute time, and distance, you need an API key from Google. You can get it for free after logging-in and enabling billing [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/overview). You should enable these three APIs for the key: Geocoding API, Maps JavaScript API, and Distance Matrix API.

You also have to enable billing for your project [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/linkedaccount).

You can then place the key in the config file. (See below)

## Configuration

You can configure different aspects for the app from the [config.js](config.js) file.

```
// We will parse the listings from this URL, open it in your browser first, adjust the filters and make sure it is in the list mode not the maps.
config.url = "https://www.pararius.com/apartments/amsterdam/1500-1900/75m2/2-bedrooms/furnished";

// Frequency of scraping and updates from Pararius in minutes. (Minimum: 15)
config.updateFrequency = 60;

// Used to calculate distance and commute time, can be any string. Please try it on Google maps first.
config.commuteAddress = "1011 DJ, Amsterdam"

// Used to calculate distance and commute time to commuteAddress. It can be: driving, walking, bicycling or transit. (transit calculate it as if you are commuting now)
config.commuteMode = "bicycling";

// Max results per page in the dashboard.
config.resultsPerPage = 20

// So as not to leech Pararius, a sane limit has to be in place.
config.maxScrapingResults = 500

// Maximum requests per second for Pararius.
config.googleApiMaxRequestPerSecond = 10

// Maximum requests per second for Google APIs.
config.googleApiMaxRequestPerSecond = 10

// Very important to calculate distance, coordinates, and displaying maps in the dashboard.
// These APIs have to be enabled on https://console.developers.google.com/: Geocoding API, Maps JavaScript API, and Distance Matrix API
config.googleApi = "GOOGLE_API_KEY"

// Where to serve the app
config.port = 8080

// File name to save the database
config.dbName = "db.json"
```

## Building And Running

_Install dependencies_:

```
npm i
```

_Start the dashboard_:

```
npm start
```

You can then go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the dashboard.
